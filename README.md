I create end-user friendly dashboards for different stakeholders.
Dashboards supposed to be easy to understand fo business and user frienly in filtering and understanding.

Most of my dashboards relate to data science projects eg. explaining features that were selected for models or storytelling for business partners how each indicators can be explained and used in our data

All of the dashboards use "dummy" data - so it does not represent any real company numbers.
